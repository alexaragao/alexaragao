I'm a Computer Engineer student who just love to code and code related stuff.

I'm a fullstack developer, currently I'm focusing on **mobile frontend** development.

_When I was a boy, I dreamt of sitting at a computer, observing a program that was and was not mine, which in turn was analyzing another program, which also was and was not mine. My mother took this for a nightmare. I saw it as the beginning of a career in coding._

### About Myself

_"You're not supposed to be in here! You're going to ruin the surprise!"_

üìê I love math stuff, the numbers just flow in my head.

üëæ I love games, in fact, I got into programming because of them. This README is full of quotes from my favorite games.

‚öñÔ∏è I may of may not have done some push forces in my life.
